2,"Peter T. Morgan, MD",https://www.ynhhs.org/physicians/peter-t-morgan,Psychiatry,"Trumbull, Bridgeport",YALE,"Peter Morgan, MD, PhD, is chair of psychiatry at Yale New Haven Health’s Bridgeport Hospital. Dr. Morgan says he grew up interested in both physics and medicine.  “I like to understand how the world works, which is why I fell in love with physics,” he says. “As for psychiatry, people have always come to me to help fix things and I have enjoyed helping others.”  Dr. Morgan says the best part of his job is feeling like he can make a positive difference in patients’ lives. “Many of the patients we serve have run into issues of not having access to treatment, being rejected from treatment, or not being comfortable accepting treatment,” he says. “When that happens, we need to find ways to get them in or bring them back. Seeing their lives improve as a result is very rewarding.”  By framing every patient interaction as having the potential to be positive or negative from a psychotherapeutic perspective, Dr. Morgan says he is mindful that how patient care is delivered affects how patients respond to treatment. “You want to have a trusting relationship, and I like to be thoughtful about every interaction going toward promoting care and building that relationship,” he says.  Dr. Morgan’s research interests include the neurophysiology of substance dependence with a focus on sleep disturbances in the setting of chronic substance use and mental illnesses."

CMHC is a collaboration between Yale School of Medicine’s Department of Psychiatry and the Connecticut Department of Mental Health & Addiction Services. 
Dr. Parke, a child, adult and forensic psychiatrist, says she decided to pursue a career in psychiatry after working as a high school counselor. “I thought that the students I was meeting with were struggling emotionally with issues that were being impacted by physiological processes,” she says. “I felt like I didn’t know enough about the body and wanted to learn more.” 
Dr. Parke says she was particularly drawn to helping people who have experienced trauma. “I’m interested in how environment might affect people, which got me interested in children and adolescents. And then I started to be interested in forensics and people’s rights, including their right to treatment and to refuse it,” she says. 
The CMHC Community Forensic Services team works with legally involved clients, including those who have been incarcerated and are returning to the community and those who have been found guilty of a crime due to insanity, as well as clients are in a residential jail diversion program and those who may need more intensive and comprehensive wrap-around services and reside at a forensic residential program.   
Dr. Parke says her favorite part of her job is building relationships with patients and learning their history. “I enjoy learning how they became who they are, who they would like to be, and figuring out how to assist them in doing that,” she says. “We don’t always have the solution for patients struggles but, in some small measure, can be on the journey with them.”"

24,"Sina Nikayin, MD",https://www.ynhhs.org/physicians/sina-nikayin,Psychiatry,New Haven,YALE,"Sina Nikayin, MD, is a psychiatrist at the Yale Interventional Psychiatry Service (IPS). Interventional psychiatrists utilize advanced modalities and procedures to treat patients who are resistant to other treatments such as medications, and who may be at higher risk of medical and psychiatric complications because of the severity of their illness.
At the IPS, Dr. Nikayin works with a variety of therapies, including ketamine, esketamine (Spravato), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to treat treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Some of these modalities can also be used to treat other psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorders and schizoaffective disorder.
“Interventional modalities can provide significant relief and improvement to patients who have been suffering from depression or other psychiatric disorders for a long time, have tried and failed multiple treatments, and may have been suffering for many years,” says Dr. Nikayin.
It’s rewarding to be able to help these patients find relief, he adds. “For me, the highest reward is when my patients experience relief from their symptoms, when they tell me that they had almost forgotten what it was like to not feel the burden of depression. Once again, they are able to genuinely laugh or enjoy activities they used to love.”
In addition to his clinical work, Dr. Nikayin is an assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine, where he and his colleagues are involved in multiple clinical research projects designed to address such topics as the effectiveness of ketamine as an antidepressant in Parkinson’s disease, the use of cognitive behavioral therapy alongside esketamine in the treatment of depression with suicidal ideation, and the effectiveness and safety of ECT compared to ketamine in treatment of depression."
25,"Christopher J. Pittenger, MD, PhD",https://www.ynhhs.org/physicians/christopher-j-pittenger,Psychiatry,New Haven,YALE,"Chris Pittenger, MD, PhD, earned his MD and PhD degrees from Columbia University, where his graduate work was done with Nobel Prize recipient Eric Kandel. He returned to Yale University, his undergraduate alma mater, for residency and research training in psychiatry in 2003. He joined the faculty as an Assistant Professor in 2007 and is now Elizabeth Mears and House Jameson Professor of Psychiatry, Professor of Psychology and in the Child Study Center, and Deputy Chair for Translational Research in the Department of Psychiatry. Dr. Pittenger has always been fascinated by the question of how the brain, a complex but ultimately a physical structure, creates thought, feeling, consciousness, and other aspects of the mind. As a psychiatrist he is additionally focused on how these processes go wrong—how brain dysregulation leads to dysregulated cognition, emotion, and behavior and to mental suffering, and how advancing our understanding of these relationships can guide us to new strategies to alleviate that suffering.  Much of his work has focused on obsessive-compulsive disorder and Tourette syndrome and on the cortico-basal ganglia circuitry that is implicated in their pathophysiology. More recently Dr. Pittenger has co-founded the Yale Program for Psychedelic Science, focusing on understanding how molecules like psilocybin and LSD can teach us about brain and behavior and may lead to new treatments for a range of neuropsychiatric pathology. He is also one of the founding Directors of the Yale Center for Brain and Mind Health, which seeks to bridge disciplines and levels of analysis to bring new therapeutics to individuals suffering from disorders of the mind and brain. Dr. Pittenger's research and clinical work have been acknowledged by a number of prestigious awards, including grant funding from the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke, NARSAD, the Tourette Syndrome of America, the Doris Duke Charitable Trust, and other organizations. He has won a number of awards, including from the National Institute of Mental Health, the Society for Neuroscience, the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American College of Psychiatrists.

He discovered that many of these PTSD patients had also suffered from traumatic brain injuries, which complicated their conditions. In 2017, he completed a fellowship in behavioral neurology/ neuropsychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine.
Currently, the majority of Dr. Fesharaki-Zadeh’s time is spent conducting research using animal models to understand traumatic brain injury and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
In addition to conducting research, Dr. Fesharaki-Zadeh also sees patients at Yale memory outpatient clinic . As a physician, his first priority is establishing trust with a patient. “A lot of the symptoms are personal, affecting their day-to-day lives, and for the patients to be able to trust their physician is of paramount importance,” he says.
  
To establish that positive relationship, Dr. Fesharaki-Zadeh will start his appointments off with open-ended questions about what prompted them to see a physician, what has changed in their lives, and where they are in their life. He will also test patients’ short- and long-term memories in order to understand the severity of their conditions.
In addition to seeing patients and conducting research, Dr. Fesharaki-Zadeh teaches psychiatry and neurology at Yale School of Medicine."

Patterson, MD",https://www.ynhhs.org/physicians/sean-c-patterson,Psychiatry,New Haven,YALE,"Sean Patterson, MD, is a psychiatrist who specializes in inpatient care and woks at Yale New Haven Psychiatric Hospital in the adult mood disorders unit. He is also an assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine and works with resident education. “My clinical focus is on helping people who are in an immediate, acute crisis. I work to maintain safety, optimize psychiatric medications, clarify diagnostic questions, and provide psychoeducation and brief therapy to patients and family members,” Dr. Patterson says.   Dr. Patterson treats patients with a broad spectrum of mental health concerns including depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, catatonia, and those utilizing interventional services such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and ketamine. He works with a treatment team of social workers, pharmacists, nurses, mental health workers, and medical trainees. Being hospitalized for a mental health crisis is not easy for patients or their loved ones. Acknowledging that patients are more than how they present to the hospital is an important part of understanding what is best for their care. Dr. Patterson works to integrate each person's long-term goals into their treatment plan and disposition.   Dr. Patterson is active in advocacy work, particularly around topics of mental illness and LGBTQ+ legislation. He works to understand how recent policy changes can affect health outcomes and access to resources for his patients. He also uses journalism as a tool to advocate for LGBTQ+ populations."

Fucito, PhD",https://www.ynhhs.org/physicians/lisa-m-fucito,Psychiatry,New Haven,YALE,"Lisa Fucito, PhD, director of the Tobacco Treatment Service at Smilow Cancer Hospital, helps patients quit or reduce cigarette smoking and their use of other tobacco and nicotine products such as e-cigarettes.
Fucito, a clinical psychologist, provides individual counseling tailored to a person’s circumstances. If they need to quit smoking for an upcoming surgery, she might meet with someone multiple times a week to help them quickly replace the ritual of lighting up at particular times with different habits. For another person uncertain about quitting smoking, she might focus counseling on increasing their motivation by emphasizing the benefits of smoking cessation at all ages. 
The Smilow service also provides prescriptions for nicotine-replacement therapies such as “the patch,” gum, lozenges, inhalers, and other FDA-approved medications such as varenicline (Chantix) and bupropion (Zyban). Additionally, patients are advised of potential tobacco harm reduction strategies such as switching to alternative tobacco products (e-cigarettes, oral nicotine products) in place of cigarettes.   
Prior to attending graduate school, Fucito worked in a psychiatric hospital helping people with alcohol and substance use disorders. “I noticed that many of these patients were smoking, but we were not addressing it,” she says. “I wanted to better understand this primary substance use disorder and help reduce the substantial public health burden of tobacco use.”
  
Fucito appreciates how hard it can be for people to change a lifelong habit like cigarette smoking, but that is also why she finds this work so rewarding. One woman who wanted to quit in advance of cancer treatment told Fucito that without her support, she would not have been able to stop smoking. “It is a tremendous privilege to help people change one of their most important health behaviors and change their health trajectory,” she says.
  
An associate professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine, Fucito studies new treatment strategies to help people with their tobacco use including a pre-surgical intervention for patients with cancer and e-cigarette cessation. She is also interested in how technology (e.g., smartphones, biosensors, social media, electronic health records) can increase the reach and effectiveness of interventions and improve health outcomes across substance use disorders."

104,"Amanda F. Lowell, PhD",https://www.ynhhs.org/physicians/amanda-f-lowell,Psychiatry,New Haven,YALE,"Amanda Lowell, PhD, is a licensed clinical psychologist and loves working with both children and their caregivers. 
""I love that the work I do impacts two generations: parent and child,"" she says. ""The positive growth and development a parent achieves in therapy has the potential to be passed down from generation to generation and improve the lives of others for years to come."" 
Lowell is trained to evaluate and treat emotional and behavioral difficulties in infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, as well as to support their caregivers and enhance parent-child relationships. She provides psychotherapy and parenting support to mothers and fathers with anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
She particularly enjoys working with mothers who have experienced adversity or struggled with addiction. Lowell also conducts developmental evaluations and screens for delays in infants and toddlers who have graduated from the neonatal intensive care unit.
“My favorite part of my job is learning each individual caregiver's story. It is a privilege to learn about a person's family and why they think, feel, and respond in the ways that they do,” she says, adding that she often tells families that there is no such thing as “perfect” parenting. “I always assumed I would work with children, but in my training, I realized each child comes with a caregiver, and they often need support of their own. Standard mental health treatment often did not incorporate adults' roles as parents into their treatment. I see my job as helping to integrate a caregiver's experience as an individual and as a parent, and how this interplay can impact and support their mental health.”
An associate research scientist at the Yale Child Study Center, her research interests include understanding the impact of addiction, adversity, and attachment on the maternal brain, and the implementation of evidence-based parenting supports for mothers with addictions.
Lowell is actively involved in the training and supervision of therapists providing Mothering from the Inside Out, an evidence-based parenting support program designed specifically for mothers in recovery from substance use disorders. She is also passionate about reducing the stigma surrounding parents with substance use disorders."

He cares for patients with Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He also treats patients with mood disorders, including depression and anxiety disorders.  

“One of the most rewarding aspects of my job is helping patients get through problems they never thought they could overcome,” Dr. Vitulano says. “Very often people feel stuck and don’t see a way out.”
Dr. Vitulano cares for patients using evidence-based treatments that are backed by scientific studies. Some of the techniques he uses include cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), mindfulness practices, and executive function training.
“To reassure patients, I often tell them I’ve seen many other people with the same illness or disorder who are now doing quite well,” he says.
Dr. Vitulano has studied and published scientific articles in many areas of psychology, including anger management, behavioral interventions, group therapy, coping with chronic illness, hypnosis, and mindfulness. He also conducts research in sports psychology, which includes, among other things, how psychology influences athletic performance.  
He also provides executive coaching for individuals and large U.S. and global companies. His coaching focuses on improving a person’s emotional intelligence, which is the ability to recognize, control, and express one’s emotions and handle interpersonal relationships empathetically."
